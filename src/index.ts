/**
 * @fileoverview Public entry point for programmatic usage. Re-exports the main
 * PlaywrightImageDownloader class along with all supporting service classes so
 * consumers can compose advanced workflows as needed.
 *
 * This module provides both the high-level orchestrator class and all individual
 * service classes for maximum flexibility. Use the main class for simple operations
 * or compose individual services for custom workflows.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * // Simple usage with the main orchestrator
 * import { PlaywrightImageDownloader } from './src/index.js';
 *
 * const downloader = new PlaywrightImageDownloader({
 *   headless: false,
 *   debug: true,
 * });
 *
 * const result = await downloader.run();
 * console.log('Downloaded:', result.stats.downloaded, 'images');
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * // Advanced usage with individual services
 * import {
 *   Config,
 *   BrowserManager,
 *   ManifestService,
 *   FileSystemService
 * } from './src/index.js';
 *
 * const config = new Config({ timeout: 60000 });
 * const browserManager = new BrowserManager(config);
 * const fsService = new FileSystemService(config);
 * const manifestService = new ManifestService(config, fsService);
 *
 * // Custom workflow implementation
 * await browserManager.initialize();
 * const { imageEntries } = await manifestService.getProcessedImageEntries();
 * // ... custom processing
 * await browserManager.cleanup();
 * ```
